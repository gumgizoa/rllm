## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `/tmp/speckit-sdd/.specify/scripts/bash/setup-tasks.sh --json` (from any working directory: it finds the project root `/tmp/speckit-sdd` from its own location) and parse FEATURE_DIR, TASKS_TEMPLATE_CONTENT, TASKS_TEMPLATE, and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. If the script exits non-zero because a file or the feature directory is not found (its hint names a `/speckit.<stage>` command), that stage has not run yet: carry it out first from its stage document (listed in `/speckit-sdd/core-workflow.md`), then run the script again. `FEATURE_DIR` and `TASKS_TEMPLATE` must be absolute paths when provided. `AVAILABLE_DOCS` is a list of document names/relative paths available under `FEATURE_DIR` (for example `research.md` or `contracts/`). For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (interface contracts), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - **IF EXISTS**: Load `/tmp/speckit-sdd/.specify/memory/constitution.md` for project principles and governance constraints
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map interface contracts to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use TASKS_TEMPLATE_CONTENT (from the JSON output above) as the structure. For compatibility with older setup scripts that omit TASKS_TEMPLATE_CONTENT, read TASKS_TEMPLATE instead. Fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks - only what this change needs in the existing repository (no project initialization, dependency installation or tool configuration)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (prerequisites shared by this change's user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish - cleanup this change needs (no repository-wide documentation, refactoring, performance or security work)
   - Keep the Setup, Foundational and Polish phase headings even when a phase has no task; such a phase holds the one line `No tasks — <reason>`
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order

## Next Stage

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context. Before moving on, confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths).

Nothing is reported at the end of this stage: no one reads a completion message, and a reply without a tool call ends the session. Once tasks.md is written, open `/speckit-sdd/stages/04-implement.md` and start the implement stage.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach. Here the task message is that request; if it says the tests are already taken care of, it means the grader's own tests, which you never see. So every user story gets test tasks under `### Tests for User Story N`, and their files are verification scripts under `/tmp/speckit-sdd/specs/001-issue/checks/` (for example `/tmp/speckit-sdd/specs/001-issue/checks/test_[name].py`), never test files in the repository.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Interfaces/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each interface contract → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each interface contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase
   - For each field with constraints in data-model.md (max length, nullable/required, enum values, validation rules), quote the constraint verbatim in the task description so it is not left to implementation-time discretion

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (only what this change needs in the existing repository; `No tasks — <reason>` if empty)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Done When

- [ ] tasks.md generated with all phases, task IDs, and file paths
- [ ] The implement stage (`/speckit-sdd/stages/04-implement.md`) opened next, with no report in between
