Now that we have a spec and tasks list ready for implementation, we will proceed with implementation of this spec by following this multi-phase process:

PHASE 1: Determine which task group(s) from tasks.md should be implemented
PHASE 2: Implement the given task(s)
PHASE 3: After ALL task groups have been implemented, produce the final verification report.

Carefully carry out the PHASE sections below in order, finishing one before the next.

Instructions to follow in sequence:

# PHASE 1: Determine Tasks

First, check if the user has already provided instructions about which task group(s) to implement.

**If the user HAS provided instructions:** Proceed to PHASE 2 and carry out the implementation of those specified task group(s) yourself.

**If the user has NOT provided instructions:**

Read `/tmp/agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` to review the available task groups, then proceed with implementation of all task groups in tasks.md, in order: carry out PHASE 2 yourself, starting with the first task group.

# PHASE 2: Implement Tasks

Now that you have the task group(s) to be implemented, proceed with implementation by following these instructions:

Implement all tasks assigned to you and ONLY those task(s) that have been assigned to you. The tasks assigned to you are those of the current task group: one task group per pass of PHASE 2. If, while implementing, you find work the change needs that no task covers (another file to change, a case the tasks miss), add it to `/tmp/agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` first, as a new sub-task of the current task group or as a new task group at the end, and implement it as an assigned task. Add lines only: do not reword or remove the tasks that are there.

## Implementation process:

1. Analyze the provided spec.md and requirements.md
2. Analyze patterns in the codebase according to its built-in workflow
3. Implement the assigned task group according to requirements and standards
4. Update `/tmp/agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` to update the tasks you've implemented to mark that as done by updating their checkbox to checked state: `- [x]`

## Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed in the codebase.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

## Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running the tests you've written (if any; they are check scripts under `/tmp/agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/checks/`, or test functions you added to an existing repository test module, run through that module with the test runner) and the existing tests of the code you changed, and ensuring they pass. An existing test that asserts the behavior the task asks to change is expected to fail: leave your change as it is and list that test in the final verification report.

## Next step

IF all tasks are now marked as done (with `- [x]`) in `/tmp/agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md`, continue with PHASE 3 below.

IF there are still tasks in tasks.md that have yet to be implemented (marked unfinished with `- [ ]`), repeat PHASE 2 for the next task group with unchecked tasks.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

IMPORTANT: Ensure that the tasks list is ALIGNED and DOES NOT CONFLICT with the user's preferences and standards as detailed in the following files:

**`agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`**

## Coding style best practices

- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Establish and follow naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files across the codebase
- **Automated Formatting**: Maintain consistent code style (indenting, line breaks, etc.)
- **Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive names that reveal intent; avoid abbreviations and single-letter variables except in narrow contexts
- **Small, Focused Functions**: Keep functions small and focused on a single task for better readability and testability
- **Consistent Indentation**: Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs) and configure your editor/linter to enforce it

**`agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`**

## Code commenting best practices

- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that explains itself through clear structure and naming
- **Minimal, helpful comments**: Add concise, minimal comments to explain large sections of code logic.
- **Don't comment changes or fixes**: Do not leave code comments that speak to recent or temporary changes or fixes. Comments should be evergreen informational texts that are relevant far into the future.

**`agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`**

## General development conventions

- **Consistent Project Structure**: Organize files and directories in a predictable, logical structure that team members can navigate easily
- **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables for configuration; never commit secrets or API keys to version control

**`agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`**

## Error handling best practices

- **User-Friendly Messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages to users without exposing technical details or security information
- **Fail Fast and Explicitly**: Validate input and check preconditions early; fail with clear error messages rather than allowing invalid state
- **Specific Exception Types**: Use specific exception/error types rather than generic ones to enable targeted handling
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Handle errors at appropriate boundaries (controllers, API layers) rather than scattering try-catch blocks everywhere
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design systems to degrade gracefully when non-critical services fail rather than breaking entirely
- **Retry Strategies**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures in external service calls
- **Clean Up Resources**: Always clean up resources (file handles, connections) in finally blocks or equivalent mechanisms

**`agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`**

## Validation best practices

- **Validate on Server Side**: Always validate on the server; never trust client-side validation alone for security or data integrity
- **Client-Side for UX**: Use client-side validation to provide immediate user feedback, but duplicate checks server-side
- **Fail Early**: Validate input as early as possible and reject invalid data before processing
- **Specific Error Messages**: Provide clear, field-specific error messages that help users correct their input
- **Allowlists Over Blocklists**: When possible, define what is allowed rather than trying to block everything that's not
- **Type and Format Validation**: Check data types, formats, ranges, and required fields systematically
- **Sanitize Input**: Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection)
- **Business Rule Validation**: Validate business rules (e.g., sufficient balance, valid dates) at the appropriate application layer
- **Consistent Validation**: Apply validation consistently across all entry points (web forms, API endpoints, background jobs)

**`agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`**

## Test coverage best practices

- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus tests on what the code does, not how it does it, to reduce brittleness
- **Clear Test Names**: Use descriptive names that explain what's being tested and the expected outcome
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolate units by mocking databases, APIs, file systems, and other external services
- **Fast Execution**: Keep unit tests fast (milliseconds) so developers run them frequently during development

# PHASE 3: Verify Implementation

Now that we've implemented all tasks in tasks.md, we must run final verifications and produce a verification report using the following MULTI-PHASE workflow:

## Workflow

### Step 1: Ensure tasks.md has been updated

Check `/tmp/agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` and ensure that all tasks and their sub-tasks are marked as completed with `- [x]`.

If a task is still marked incomplete, then verify that it has in fact been completed by checking the following:
- Run a brief spot check in the code to find evidence that this task's details have been implemented

IF you have concluded that this task has been completed, then mark it's checkbox and its' sub-tasks checkboxes as completed with `- [x]`.

IF you have concluded that this task has NOT been completed, then mark this checkbox with ⚠️ and note it's incompleteness in your verification report.

### Step 2: Run the tests of the changed code

Run the tests of the changed code once more: the test modules that cover the files you changed, and the tests you wrote. Run the entire tests suite as well only if it finishes within a few minutes.  Verify how many tests are passing and how many have failed or produced errors.

Include these counts and the list of failed tests in your final verification report.

DO NOT attempt to fix any failing tests.  Just note their failures in your final verification report.

### Step 3: Create final verification report

Create your final verification report in `/tmp/agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/verifications/final-verification.md`.

The content of this report should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Verification Report: [Spec Title]

**Spec:** `[spec-name]`
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed | ⚠️ Passed with Issues | ❌ Failed

---

[Brief 2-3 sentence overview of the verification results and overall implementation quality]

---

## 1. Tasks Verification

**Status:** ✅ All Complete | ⚠️ Issues Found

### Completed Tasks
